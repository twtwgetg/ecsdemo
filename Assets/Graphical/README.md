# Graphical samples

*Samples demonstrating how to work with certain graphical elements.*

## AnimateGameObject sample

This sample demonstrates an entity that logically controls an animated GameObject.

## RenderSwap sample

Change the material of rendered entities at runtime.

## ShaderGraph sample

This sample defines material override components, which allow you to control shader parameters by setting the override component values.

## Splines sample

This sample uses baking to define a spline. At runtime, boxes move along the spline paths. 

## TextureUpdate sample

This sample uses Burst-compiled jobs to efficiently generate a texture.

## WireframeBlob sample

This sample constructs a blob wireframe for a complex mesh. Enable Gizmos to see the wireframe. In game, click on the ground to spawn additional instances.
